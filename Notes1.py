# Math operators, there are 6
# +, -, *, /, **, %

# ** represents exponents
# % represents modulo division

print(4 + 8) #12
print(8 - 2) #6
print(10 * 2) # 20
print(100 / 2) #50
print(2 ** 4) #16
print(12 % 5) #2
print(6 % 3) #0
print(16 % 9) #7

# + , and * are overloaded that means they do different things based on 
# inputs

print('hello' + 'there') # this is called concatenation
print('4' + '8')
print('4' + str(8))
